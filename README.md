# Snake-Game
This is a simple Snake game built using Java and Swing for graphical user interface (GUI) rendering. The player controls a snake that moves around the screen, collecting apples to grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with its body or the borders of the screen. The score increases as the snake eats more apples.
